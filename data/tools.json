    "short_description": "AIMolDesigner enables AI-driven de novo drug design, guiding chemists in creating optimized compounds based on pharmacophore or activity constraints.",
    "long_description": "AIMolDesigner is a specialized platform for de novo molecular design using AI. It combines generative deep learning models with reinforcement learning to create novel compounds that satisfy user-defined criteria, such as binding affinity, lipophilicity, or ADMET properties. The interface allows chemists to set constraints, seed molecules, or pharmacophoric features and generate diverse libraries of potential candidates. AIMolDesigner is used widely in early-stage drug discovery and hit-to-lead optimization. Its real-time feedback on molecular properties and synthetic accessibility makes it a valuable tool for structure-based design. The platform can be integrated into existing pipelines via API or used interactively via a secure web interface.",
